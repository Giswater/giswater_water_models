## WELCOME TO GISWATER PROJECT-WATER MODELS
Water management has always been complex and expensive. It has always been difficult to plan new water supply networks or effective control existing ones without making further capital investments. Nonetheless all these situations have come to an end. Since 2014 when GISWATER was born, it have been the first open source software specifically designed for water supply and water management. <br>

This software connects different IT solutions and pre-existent databases allowing you to setup a high performance management system in combination with hydraulic software as well EPANET or SWMM.<br>

GISWATER is the first open source tool for the integral water cycle management. It was especially developed and designed for city councils, municipality administrations, water and sewerage services concessionary companies and hydraulic professionals. Giswater is a driver that connects different hydraulic analysis tools and spatial database through which the user 
has access from any geographic information system (GIS). It is compatible with all the elements that compose a water supply or sewerage management system like EPANET, EPA SWMM, GIS, WMS or SCADA and therefore it can be incorporated to the informatic ecosystem of any entity or company dedicated to water management and multiply its benefits.<br>

It is also possible to integrate business management tools like ERP, CRM or Business Intelligence and also corporate mobile devices.<br>

As well as Giswater is developed in Python (qgis plugin) and PL/SQL(PostgreSQL database) there are three main repositories to manage it (QGIS-PLUGIN, DB-MODEL and DOCS). 

This is an ARCHIVED repository. For more information about to getting started with Giswater you can visit the README.md file of one the main repositories:
